## What is this game about?

The game randomly shuffles all the cards. User has to flip and match all cards in the fewer number of moves. The user wins once all cards have successfully been matched. There is a star rating process based on the number of moves the user takes to succesfully match all cards, 3 starts is the highest score while the number of stars would decrease with number of user misses.

## Instructions

The starter project was a static version of the Memory Game provided by Udacity as a baseline for the Project Matching Game. To complete the course, I have converted this project to an interactive one modifying the HTML, CSS files and JavaScript file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me) or [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).
